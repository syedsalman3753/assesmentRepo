Create a reusable Terraform module for AWS Security Groups with dynamic rule management

Scenario: Your development teams need to create security groups for various applications (web servers, databases, microservices, etc.).
Each application has different ingress and egress requirements that change frequently. Hard-coding individual aws_security_group_rule resources for each rule is not scalable.
Requirements:
Create a Terraform module that accepts a variable containing multiple ingress and egress rules
Dynamically create all security group rules from the variable input
Support different rule types:
CIDR block-based rules
Source/destination security group rules
Prefix list rules
Handle optional parameters (description, protocol, port ranges)
Make it reusable across different applications and environments
